Analyze the provided Python code for PEP 8 violations, potential issues, or areas of improvement. Use a Chain of Thought (CoT) approach to systematically evaluate the code by following these steps:
1.	Code Parsing: Begin by reading and parsing the code to understand its structure, logic, and purpose.
2.	PEP 8 Compliance Check: Identify any violations of PEP 8 guidelines, such as indentation errors, line length issues, improper naming conventions, or missing whitespace.
3.	Potential Issues Detection: Look for potential functional or logical issues, such as syntax errors, unused variables, incorrect imports, or inefficient code.
4.	Readability and Maintainability: Assess the code for readability and maintainability, including comments, docstrings, and overall organization.
5.	Summary and Table Creation: Compile the findings into a detailed table with the following columns:
•	Severity (e.g., warning, error, suggestion, etc.) – Indicate the severity level of the issue.
•	Message – Provide a clear and descriptive explanation of the identified issue.
•	Source – Specify the source or type of the issue (e.g., PEP 8 violation, syntax error, logical error, etc.).
•	Start Line Number – Indicate the line number in the code where the issue begins.
Ensure the analysis is thorough, logical, and covers all aspects of the code. Provide the table in a well-structured format for easy readability and reference.
